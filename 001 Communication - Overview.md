# Communication - Overview
## What is communication?
To provide a baseline and shared understanding of how (textual) communication comes into existance, let's outline some discrete steps on how communication happens in the first place. Keeping in mind that verbal communication happens fluently, but these steps apply much better to textual communication.

- The formation of communicative motivation or reason.
- Message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what exactly to express).
- Message encoding (for example, into digital data, written text, speech, pictures, gestures and so on).
- Transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific channel or medium.
- Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers.
- Reception of signals and reassembling of the encoded message from a sequence of received signals.
- Decoding of the reassembled encoded message.
- Interpretation and making sense of the presumed original message.

## Target audience
When determening how to properly convey a message to some receiver, we first have to determine what kind of receiver we're dealing with. Are we talking to a friend, a collegue, a small / large group of people? If we're communicating with some group of people, are these people expected to ingest the message, formulate their own opinions and communicate these opinions back to the sender, or are they expected to simply expected to ingest the message and act on their interpretation? What is the level of understanding of the target audience? Are we sending out a simple notification, or do are we explaining some complex component of a system?

Usually this determenation is made subconciously, but some times it really is necessary to conciously think about what audience we're dealing with, to make sure our message is able to be received, decoded and interpreted by our audience. 

## Brevity or verbosity?

Once the target audience has been determined, another consideration is how densely the sender encodes information in their message.
